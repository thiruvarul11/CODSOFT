🚀 CodSoft Machine Learning Internship – Project Summary
📅 Duration: July 1, 2025 – July 31, 2025
🧑‍💻 Intern: Thiruvarul K
🏢 Organization: CodSoft
💼 Internship Domain: Machine Learning
📁 Repository: CODSOFT GitHub Repo ( https://github.com/thiruvarul11/CODSOFT.git )
📌 Overview
As part of the CodSoft Virtual Internship Program, I successfully completed three hands-on machine learning projects using real-world datasets. This internship helped me enhance my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization using Python and popular ML libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Each project demonstrates my ability to handle different types of ML tasks including binary classification, natural language processing, and business problem-solving.
